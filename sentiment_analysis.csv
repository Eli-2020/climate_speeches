Our Lives Are In Your Hands ;September 8,2018;"Last summer, climate scientist Johan Rockström and some other people wrote that we have at most three years to reverse growth in greenhouse-gas emissions if we’re going to reach the goals set in the Paris agreement.
Over a year and two months have now passed, and in that time many other scientists have said the same thing and a lot of things have got worse and greenhouse-gas emissions continue to increase. So maybe we have even less time than the one year and ten months Johan Rockström said we have left.
If people knew this they wouldn’t need to ask me why I’m so “passionate about climate change.”
If people knew that the scientists say that we have a five percent chance of meeting the Paris target, and if people knew what a nightmare scenario we will face if we don’t keep global warming below 2 °C, they wouldn’t need to ask me why I’m on school strike outside parliament.
Because if everyone knew how serious the situation is and how little is actually being done, everyone would come and sit down beside us.
In Sweden, we live our lives as if we had the resources of 4.2 planets. Our carbon footprint is one of the ten worst in the world. This means that Sweden steals 3.2 years of natural resources from future generations every year. Those of us who are part of these future generations would like Sweden to stop doing that.
Right now.
This is not a political text. Our school strike has nothing to do with party politics.
Because the climate and the biosphere don’t care about our politics and our empty words for a single second.
They only care about what we actually do.
This is a cry for help.
To all the newspapers who still don’t write about and report on climate change even though they said that the climate was “the critical question of our time” when the Swedish forests were burning this summer.
To all of you who have never treated this crisis as a crisis.
To all the influencers who stand up for everything except the climate and the environment.
To all the political parties that pretend to take the climate question seriously.
To all the politicians that ridicule us on social media, and have named and shamed me so that people tell me that I’m retarded, a bitch and a terrorist, and many other things.
To all of you who choose to look the other way every day because you seem more frightened of the changes that can prevent catastrophic climate change than the catastrophic climate change itself.
Your silence is almost worst of all.
The future of all the coming generations rests on your shoulder.
Those of us who are still children can’t change what you do now once we’re old enough to do something about it.
A lot of people say that Sweden is a small country, that it doesn’t matter what we do. But I think that if a few girls can get headlines all over the world just by not going to school for a few weeks, imagine what we could do together if we wanted to.
Every single person counts.
Just like every single emission counts.
Every single kilo.
Everything counts.
So please, treat the climate crisis like the acute crisis it is and give us a future.
Our lives are in your hands.";['last', 'summer', 'climate', 'scientist', 'johan', 'rockström', 'people', 'wrote', 'three', 'year', 'reverse', 'growth', 'greenhousegas', 'emission', 'going', 'reach', 'goal', 'set', 'paris', 'agreement', 'year', 'two', 'month', 'passed', 'time', 'many', 'scientist', 'said', 'thing', 'lot', 'thing', 'got', 'worse', 'greenhousegas', 'emission', 'continue', 'increase', 'maybe', 'le', 'time', 'year', 'ten', 'month', 'johan', 'rockström', 'said', 'left', 'people', 'knew', 'need', 'ask', 'passionate', 'climate', 'change', 'people', 'knew', 'scientist', 'five', 'percent', 'chance', 'meeting', 'paris', 'target', 'people', 'knew', 'nightmare', 'scenario', 'face', 'keep', 'global', 'warming', 'c', 'need', 'ask', 'school', 'strike', 'outside', 'parliament', 'everyone', 'knew', 'serious', 'situation', 'little', 'actually', 'done', 'everyone', 'would', 'come', 'sit', 'beside', 'u', 'sweden', 'live', 'life', 'resource', 'planet', 'carbon', 'footprint', 'ten', 'worst', 'world', 'mean', 'sweden', 'steal', 'year', 'natural', 'resource', 'future', 'generation', 'every', 'year', 'u', 'part', 'future', 'generation', 'would', 'sweden', 'stop', 'right', 'political', 'text', 'school', 'strike', 'nothing', 'party', 'politics', 'climate', 'biosphere', 'care', 'politics', 'empty', 'word', 'single', 'second', 'care', 'actually', 'cry', 'help', 'newspaper', 'write', 'report', 'climate', 'change', 'though', 'said', 'climate', 'critical', 'question', 'time', 'swedish', 'forest', 'burning', 'summer', 'never', 'treated', 'crisis', 'crisis', 'influencers', 'stand', 'everything', 'except', 'climate', 'environment', 'political', 'party', 'pretend', 'take', 'climate', 'question', 'seriously', 'politician', 'ridicule', 'u', 'social', 'medium', 'named', 'shamed', 'people', 'tell', 'retarded', 'bitch', 'terrorist', 'many', 'thing', 'choose', 'look', 'way', 'every', 'day', 'seem', 'frightened', 'change', 'prevent', 'catastrophic', 'climate', 'change', 'catastrophic', 'climate', 'change', 'silence', 'almost', 'worst', 'future', 'coming', 'generation', 'rest', 'shoulder', 'u', 'child', 'change', 'old', 'enough', 'something', 'lot', 'people', 'sweden', 'small', 'country', 'matter', 'think', 'girl', 'headline', 'world', 'going', 'school', 'week', 'imagine', 'could', 'together', 'wanted', 'every', 'single', 'person', 'count', 'every', 'single', 'emission', 'count', 'every', 'single', 'kilo', 'everything', 'count', 'please', 'treat', 'climate', 'crisis', 'acute', 'crisis', 'give', 'u', 'future', 'life', 'hand'];-0.06992424242424243;0.36117559523809517
Almost Everything is Black and White;October 31,2018;"When I was about eight years old, I first heard about something called climate change, or global warming. Apparently, that was something humans had created by our way of living. I was told to turn off the lights to save energy and to recycle paper to save resources.
I remember thinking that it was very strange, that humans who are an animal species among others, could be capable of changing the earth's climate. Because, if we were and if it was really happening, we wouldn’t be talking about anything else. As soon as you turned on the TV, everything would be about that. Headlines, radio, newspapers. You would never read or hear about anything else. As if there was a world war going on.
But. No one never talked about it.
If burning fossil fuels was so bad, that it threatened our very existence, how could we just continue like before? Why were there no restrictions? Why wasn’t it made illegal?
To me, that did not add up. It was too unreal.
I have Asperger's syndrome, and to me, almost everything is black or white.
I think in many ways that we autistic are the normal ones and the rest of the people are pretty strange. They keep saying that climate change is an existential threat and the most important issue of all. And yet they just carry on like before. If the emissions have to stop then we must stop the emissions. To me, that is black or white. There are no grey areas when it comes to survival. Either we go on as a civilization or we don’t. We have to change.
Countries like Sweden and the UK need to start reducing emissions by at least 15% every year. And that is so that we can stay below a 2-degree warming target. Now the IPCC says that we have to aim for 1,5 degrees. So we can only imagine what that means. You would think every one of our leaders and the media would be talking about nothing else — but no one ever mentions it. Nor does anyone ever mention anything about the greenhouse gases already locked in the system, nor that air pollution is hiding a warming, so when we stop burning fossil fuels, we already have an extra 0,5 to 1,1 degrees celsius guaranteed.
Nor does hardly anyone ever mention that we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction, with about 200 species going extinct every single day.
Furthermore, does no one ever speak about the aspect of equity, or climate justice, clearly stated everywhere in the Paris agreement and the Kyoto protocol, which is absolutely necessary to make the Paris agreement work, on a global scale. That means that rich countries need to get down to zero emissions, within 6–12 years, so that people in poorer countries can heighten their standard of living by building some of the infrastructures that we have already built. Such as roads, hospitals, electricity, schools, and clean drinking water. Because how can we expect countries like India or Nigeria to care about the climate crisis if we, who already have everything, don’t care even a second about it or our actual commitments to the Paris agreement?
So, why are we not reducing our emissions? Why are they, in fact, still increasing? Are we knowingly causing a mass extinction? Are we evil?
No, of course not. People keep doing what they do because the vast majority doesn’t have a clue about the consequences of our everyday life. And they don’t know the rapid changes required.
Since, as I said before, no one talks about it. There are no headlines, no emergency meetings, no breaking news. No one is acting as if we were in a crisis. Even most green politicians and climate scientists go on flying around the world, eating meat and dairy.
If I live to be 100 I will be alive in the year 2103.
When you think about “the future” today, you don’t think beyond the year 2050. By then I will, in the best case, not even have lived half of my life. What happens next?
The year 2078 I will celebrate my 75th birthday.
What we do or don’t do, right now, will affect my entire life, and the lives of my children and grandchildren.
When school started in August this year I decided that this was enough. I sat myself down on the ground outside the Swedish parliament. I school strikes for the climate.
Some people say that I should be in school instead. Some people say that I should study to become a climate scientist so that I can ”solve the climate crisis”. But the climate crisis has already been solved. We already have all the facts and solutions. All we have to do is to wake up and change.
And why should I be studying for a future that soon will be no more, when no one is doing anything whatsoever to save that future? And what is the point of learning facts within the school system when the most important facts given by the finest science of that same school system clearly means nothing to our politicians and our society?
A lot of people say that Sweden is just a small country and that it doesn’t matter what we do. But I think that if a few children can get headlines all over the world just by not going to school for a few weeks, imagine what we all could do together if we wanted to.
Today we use 100 million barrels of oil every day. There are no politics to change that. There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground.
So we can’t save the world by playing by the rules. Because the rules have to be changed.
Everything needs to change. And it has to start today.

Save the World by Changing the Rules;November 24, 2018;"When I was about eight years old,
I first heard about something called climate change or global warming.
Apparently, that was something humans have created by our way of living.
I was told to turn off the lights to save energy and to recycle paper to save resources.
I remember thinking that it was very strange that humans, who are an animal species among others, could be capable of changing the Earth's climate.
Because if we were, and if it was really happening, we wouldn't be talking about anything else.
As soon as you'd turn on the TV, everything would be about that.
Headlines, radio, newspapers, you would never read or hear about anything else, as if there was a world war going on.
But no one ever talked about it.
If burning fossil fuels was so bad that it threatened our very existence, how could we just continue like before?
Why were there no restrictions?
Why wasn't it made illegal?
To me, that did not add up.
It was too unreal.
So when I was 11, I became ill.
I fell into depression, I stopped talking, and I stopped eating.
In two months, I lost about 10 kilos of weight.
Later on, I was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, OCD and selective mutism.
That basically means I only speak when I think it's necessary - now is one of those moments.
(Applause)
For those of us who are on the spectrum, almost everything is black or white.
We aren't very good at lying, and we usually don't enjoy participating in this social game that the rest of you seem so fond of.
(Laughter)
I think in many ways that we autistic are the normal ones,and the rest of the people are pretty strange,
(Laughter)
especially when it comes to the sustainability crisis, where everyone keeps saying climate change is an existential threat and the most important issue of all, and yet they just carry on like before.
I don't understand that, because if the emissions have to stop, then we must stop the emissions.
To me that is black or white.There are no gray areas when it comes to survival.
Either we go on as a civilization or we don't.We have to change.
Rich countries like Sweden need to start reducing emissions by at least 15 percent every year.
And that is so that we can stay below a two-degree warming target.
Yet, as the IPCC have recently demonstrated, aiming instead for 1.5 degrees Celsius would significantly reduce the climate impacts.
But we can only imagine what that means for reducing emissions.
You would think the media and every one of our leaders would be talking about nothing else, but they never even mention it.
Nor does anyone ever mention the greenhouse gases already locked in the system.
Nor that air pollution is hiding a warming so that when we stop burning fossil fuels, we already have an extra level of warming perhaps as high as 0.5 to 1.1 degrees Celsius.
Furthermore does hardly anyone speak about the fact that we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction,with up to 200 species going extinct every single day,that the extinction rate today is between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than what is seen as normal.
Nor does hardly anyone ever speak about the aspect of equity or climate justice,clearly stated everywhere in the Paris Agreement,which is absolutely necessary to make it work on a global scale.
That means that rich countries need to get down to zero emissions within 6 to 12 years,with today's emission speed.
And that is so that people in poorer countries can have a chance to heighten their standard of living
by building some of the infrastructure that we have already built,such as roads, schools, hospitals, clean drinking water, electricity, and so on.
Because how can we expect countries like India or Nigeria to care about the climate crisis if we who already have everything don't care even a second about it
or our actual commitments to the Paris Agreement?
So, why are we not reducing our emissions?
Why are they in fact still increasing?
Are we knowingly causing a mass extinction?
Are we evil?
No, of course not.
People keep doing what they do because the vast majority doesn't have a clue about the actual consequences of our everyday life,and they don't know that rapid change is required.
We all think we know, and we all think everybody knows,but we don't.
Because how could we?
If there really was a crisis,and if this crisis was caused by our emissions, you would at least see some signs.
Not just flooded cities, tens of thousands of dead people,and whole nations leveled to piles of torn down buildings.
You would see some restrictions.
But no.
And no one talks about it.
There are no emergency meetings, no headlines, no breaking news.
No one is acting as if we were in a crisis.
Even most climate scientists or green politicians
keep on flying around the world, eating meat and dairy.
If I live to be 100, I will be alive in the year 2103.
When you think about the future today, you don't think beyond the year 2050.
By then, I will, in the best case, not even have lived half of my life.
What happens next?
The year 2078, I will celebrate my 75th birthday.
If I have children or grandchildren, maybe they will spend that day with me.
Maybe they will ask me about you,
the people who were around, back in 2018.
Maybe they will ask why you didn't do anything while there still was time to act.
What we do or don't do right now will affect my entire life and the lives of my children and grandchildren.
What we do or don't do right now, me and my generation can't undo in the future.
So when school started in August of this year,I decided that this was enough.
I set myself down on the ground outside the Swedish parliament.
I school striked for the climate.
Some people say that I should be in school instead. Some people say that I should study to become a climate scientist so that I can solve the climate crisis.But the climate crisis has already been solved.We already have all the facts and solutions.

just by not coming to school for a few weeks,imagine what we could all do together if you wanted to.
(Applause)
Now we're almost at the end of my talk,and this is where people usually start talking about hope,solar panels, wind power, circular economy, and so on,but I'm not going to do that.
We've had 30 years of pep-talking and selling positive ideas.
And I'm sorry, but it doesn't work.
Because if it would have,the emissions would have gone down by now.
They haven't.
And yes, we do need hope,of course we do.
But the one thing we need more than hope is action.
Once we start to act, hope is everywhere.
So instead of looking for hope,look for action.
Then, and only then, hope will come.
Today, we use 100 million barrels of oil every single day.
There are no politics to change that.
There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground.
So we can't save the world by playing by the rules,because the rules have to be changed.
Everything needs to change,and it has to start today.

Many people say that Sweden is just a small country, and it doesn't matter what we do, but I've learned that you are never too small to make a difference, and if a few children can get headlines all over the world just by not going to school, then imagine what we could all do
together if we really wanted to. But to do that we have to speak clearly, no matter how uncomfortable that may be. You only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular. You only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake. You are not mature enough to tell it like it is, even that burden you leave to us children, but I don't care about being popular. I care about climate justice and the living planet. Our civilisation is being sacrificed for the opportunity of a very
small number of people to continue making enormous amounts of money.
Our biosphere is being sacrificed so that rich people in countries like mine can live in luxury. It is the sufferings of the many which pay for the luxuries of the few. In the year 2078, I will celebrate my 75th birthday. If I have children maybe they will spend that day with me, maybe they will ask me about you.
Maybe they will ask why you didn't do anything, while there still was time to act. You say you love your children above all else, and yet you're stealing their future in front of their very eyes. Until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible, there is no hope. We cannot solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis. We need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground and we need to focus on equity. And if solutions within this system are so impossible to find then maybe we should change the system itself.
We have not come here to beg world leaders to care, you have ignored us in the past and you will ignore us again. We have run out of excuses and we are running out of time. We have come here to let you know that change is coming whether you like it or not. The real power belongs to the people.

You are Acting Like Spoiled Irresponsible Children;February 21, 2019 ;"My name is Greta Thunberg, I am a climate activist from Sweden and today in this room there are also - if you can come up - Anuna, Adélaïde, Kyra, Gilles, Dries, Toon and Luisa.
Tens of thousands of children or schools are striking for the climate on the streets of Brussels. Hundreds of thousands are doing the same all over the world. We are school striking because we have done our homework. And some of us are here today. People always tell us that they are so hopeful. They are hopeful that the young people are going to save the world, but we are not. There is simply not enough time to wait for us to grow up and become the ones in charge. Because by the year 2020 we need to have bended the emissions curve steep downward.
That is next year. We know that most politicians don't want to talk to us. Good, we don't want to talk to them either. We want them to talk to the scientists instead. Listen to them, because we are just repeating what they are saying and have been saying for decades. We want you to follow the Paris agreement and the IPCC reports. We don't have any other manifests or demands, you unite behind the science that is our demand. When many politicians talk about the school strike for the climate, they talk about almost anything except for the climate crisis.
Many people are trying to make the school strikes a question of whether we are promoting truancy or whether we should go back to school or not. They make up all sorts of conspiracies and call us puppets who cannot think for ourselves. They are desperately trying to remove the focus from the climate crisis and change the subject. They don't want to talk about it because they know they cannot win this fight. Because they know they haven't done their homework, but we have. Once you have done your homework you realize that we need new politics, we need new economics where everything is based on a rapidly declining and extremely limited remaining carbon budget.
But that is not enough. We need a whole new way of thinking. The political system that you have created is all about competition. You cheat when you can, because all that matters is to win, to get power. That must come to an end, we must stop competing with each other, we need to cooperate and work together and to share the resources of the planet in a fair way. We need to start living within the planetary boundaries, focus on equity and take a few steps back for the sake of all living species. We need to protect the biosphere, the air, the oceans, the soil, the forests.
This may sound very naive, but if you have done your homework then you know that we don't have any other choice. We need to focus every inch of our being on climate change, because if we fail to do so than all our achievements and progress have been for nothing and all that will remain of our political leaders’ legacy will be the greatest failure of human history. And they will be remembered as the greatest villains of all time, because they have chosen not to listen and not to act. But this does not have to be. There is still time. According to the IPCC report we are about 11 years away from being in a position where we set off an irreversible chain reaction beyond human control.
To avoid that unprecedented changes in all aspects of society, [actions] need to have taken place within this coming decade, including a reduction of our CO2 emissions by at least 50 percent by the year 2030. And please note that those numbers do not include the aspect of equity, which is absolutely necessary to make the Paris agreement work on a global scale, nor do they include tipping points or feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas released from the thawing Arctic permafrost. They do, however, include negative emission techniques on a huge planetary scale that is yet to be invented, and that many scientists fear will never be ready in time and will anyway be impossible to deliver at the scale assumed. 
We have been told that the EU intends to improve its emission reduction targets. In the new target, the EU is proposing to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 45 percent below 1990’s level by 2030. 
Some people say that is good or that is ambitious. But this new target is still not enough to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.
This target is not sufficient to protect the future for children growing up today. If the EU is to make its fair contribution to staying within the carbon budget for the two-degree limit, then it means a minimum of 80 percent reduction by 2030 and that includes aviation and shipping. So [it is] around twice as ambitious as the current proposal. The actions required are beyond manifestos or any party politics. Once again, they sweep their mess under the carpet for our generation to clean up and solve. Some people say that we are fighting for our future, but that is not true. We are not fighting for our future, we are fighting for everyone's future. And if you think that we should be in school instead, then we suggest that you take our place in the streets striking from your work. Or better yet, join us so it can speed up the process.
And I am sorry, but saying everything will be alright while continue doing nothing at all is just not hopeful to us. In fact, it's the opposite of hope. And yet this is exactly what you keep doing. You can't just sit around waiting for hope to come, you're acting like spoiled irresponsible children. You don't seem to understand that hope is something you have to earn. And if you still say that we are wasting valuable lesson time then let me remind you that our political leaders have wasted decades through denial and inaction. And since our time is running out we have decided to take action. We have started to clean up your mess and we will not stop until we are done.";['name', 'greta', 'thunberg', 'climate', 'activist', 'sweden', 'today', 'room', 'also', 'come', 'anuna', 'adélaïde', 'kyra', 'gilles', 'dry', 'toon', 'luisa', 'ten', 'thousand', 'child', 'school', 'striking', 'climate', 'street', 'brussels', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'world', 'school', 'striking', 'done', 'homework', 'u', 'today', 'people', 'always', 'tell', 'u', 'hopeful', 'hopeful', 'young', 'people', 'going', 'save', 'world', 'simply', 'enough', 'time', 'wait', 'u', 'grow', 'become', 'one', 'charge', 'year', 'need', 'bended', 'emission', 'curve', 'steep', 'downward', 'next', 'year', 'know', 'politician', 'dont', 'want', 'talk', 'u', 'good', 'dont', 'want', 'talk', 'either', 'want', 'talk', 'scientist', 'instead', 'listen', 'repeating', 'saying', 'saying', 'decade', 'want', 'follow', 'paris', 'agreement', 'ipcc', 'report', 'dont', 'manifest', 'demand', 'unite', 'behind', 'science', 'demand', 'many', 'politician', 'talk', 'school', 'strike', 'climate', 'talk', 'almost', 'anything', 'except', 'climate', 'crisis', 'many', 'people', 'trying', 'make', 'school', 'strike', 'question', 'whether', 'promoting', 'truancy', 'whether', 'go', 'back', 'school', 'make', 'sort', 'conspiracy', 'call', 'u', 'puppet', 'cannot', 'think', 'desperately', 'trying', 'remove', 'focus', 'climate', 'crisis', 'change', 'subject', 'dont', 'want', 'talk', 'know', 'cannot', 'win', 'fight', 'know', 'havent', 'done', 'homework', 'done', 'homework', 'realize', 'need', 'new', 'politics', 'need', 'new', 'economics', 'everything', 'based', 'rapidly', 'declining', 'extremely', 'limited', 'remaining', 'carbon', 'budget', 'enough', 'need', 'whole', 'new', 'way', 'thinking', 'political', 'system', 'created', 'competition', 'cheat', 'matter', 'win', 'power', 'must', 'come', 'end', 'must', 'stop', 'competing', 'need', 'cooperate', 'work', 'together', 'share', 'resource', 'planet', 'fair', 'way', 'need', 'start', 'living', 'within', 'planetary', 'boundary', 'focus', 'equity', 'take', 'step', 'back', 'sake', 'living', 'specie', 'need', 'protect', 'biosphere', 'air', 'ocean', 'soil', 'forest', 'may', 'sound', 'naive', 'done', 'homework', 'know', 'dont', 'choice', 'need', 'focus', 'every', 'inch', 'climate', 'change', 'fail', 'achievement', 'progress', 'nothing', 'remain', 'political', 'leader', 'legacy', 'greatest', 'failure', 'human', 'history', 'remembered', 'greatest', 'villain', 'time', 'chosen', 'listen', 'act', 'time', 'according', 'ipcc', 'report', 'year', 'away', 'position', 'set', 'irreversible', 'chain', 'reaction', 'beyond', 'human', 'control', 'avoid', 'unprecedented', 'change', 'aspect', 'society', 'action', 'need', 'taken', 'place', 'within', 'coming', 'decade', 'including', 'reduction', 'co', 'emission', 'least', 'percent', 'year', 'please', 'note', 'number', 'include', 'aspect', 'equity', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'make', 'paris', 'agreement', 'work', 'global', 'scale', 'include', 'tipping', 'point', 'feedback', 'loop', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'methane', 'gas', 'released', 'thawing', 'arctic', 'permafrost', 'however', 'include', 'negative', 'emission', 'technique', 'huge', 'planetary', 'scale', 'yet', 'invented', 'many', 'scientist', 'fear', 'never', 'ready', 'time', 'anyway', 'impossible', 'deliver', 'scale', 'assumed', 'told', 'eu', 'intends', 'improve', 'emission', 'reduction', 'target', 'new', 'target', 'eu', 'proposing', 'reduce', 'greenhouse', 'gas', 'emission', 'percent', 'level', 'people', 'good', 'ambitious', 'new', 'target', 'enough', 'keep', 'global', 'warming', 'degree', 'celsius', 'target', 'sufficient', 'protect', 'future', 'child', 'growing', 'today', 'eu', 'make', 'fair', 'contribution', 'staying', 'within', 'carbon', 'budget', 'twodegree', 'limit', 'mean', 'minimum', 'percent', 'reduction', 'includes', 'aviation', 'shipping', 'around', 'twice', 'ambitious', 'current', 'proposal', 'action', 'required', 'beyond', 'manifesto', 'party', 'politics', 'sweep', 'mess', 'carpet', 'generation', 'clean', 'solve', 'people', 'fighting', 'future', 'true', 'fighting', 'future', 'fighting', 'everyones', 'future', 'think', 'school', 'instead', 'suggest', 'take', 'place', 'street', 'striking', 'work', 'better', 'yet', 'join', 'u', 'speed', 'process', 'sorry', 'saying', 'everything', 'alright', 'continue', 'nothing', 'hopeful', 'u', 'fact', 'opposite', 'hope', 'yet', 'exactly', 'keep', 'cant', 'sit', 'around', 'waiting', 'hope', 'come', 'youre', 'acting', 'spoiled', 'irresponsible', 'child', 'dont', 'seem', 'understand', 'hope', 'something', 'earn', 'wasting', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'time', 'let', 'remind', 'political', 'leader', 'wasted', 'decade', 'denial', 'inaction', 'since', 'time', 'running', 'decided', 'take', 'action', 'started', 'clean', 'mess', 'stop', 'done'];0.1292507605007605;0.4565732128232127
A Strange World;March 30, 2019;"thank you. I want to dedicate this prize to those protecting the Hambach forests and to the climate activists who fight to keep the fossil fuels in the ground everywhere.
we live in a strange world, where the United science tells us that we are about 11 years away from setting off an irreversible chain reaction, way beyond
human control that will probably be the end of our civilization as we know it.
we live in a strange world where children must sacrifice their education in order to protest against the destruction of their future. 
worth of people who have contributed the least to this crisis are the ones who are going to be affected the most, where politicians say it's too expensive to save the world while spending trillions of euros subsidizing fossil fuels.
we live in a strange world where no one dares to look beyond our current political systems even though it's clear that the answers we seek will not be found within the politics of today.
where some people seem to be more concerned about the presence in school of some children than the future of humankind.
where everyone can choose their own reality and buy their own truth, where our survival is depending on a small rapidly disappearing carbon budget and hardly anyone even knows it exists where we think we can buy and build our way out of a crisis that has been created by buying and building stuff.
we're a football game or a film gala gets more media attention than the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced.
we're celebrities film and pop stars who have stood up against all injustice will not stand up for the environment and for climate justice because that would inflict on their right to fly around the
world visiting their favorite restaurants beaches and yoga retreats.
avoiding catastrophic climate breakdown is to do the seemingly impossible and yet that is what we have to do, but here's the truth we can't do it without you in the audience here tonight people
see you celebrities as gods you influence billions of people we need you, you can use your voice to raise awareness about this global crisis, you can help turn individuals into movements you can help us wake up the leaders and
let them know that our house is on fire.
we live in a strange world but it's the world that my generation has been handed it's the only world we've got. we are now standing at a crossroads in history we are failing but we have not yet failed there is still time and to fix this it's up to us. thank you.";['thank', 'want', 'dedicate', 'prize', 'protecting', 'hambach', 'forest', 'climate', 'activist', 'fight', 'keep', 'fossil', 'fuel', 'ground', 'everywhere', 'live', 'strange', 'world', 'united', 'science', 'tell', 'u', 'year', 'away', 'setting', 'irreversible', 'chain', 'reaction', 'way', 'beyond', 'human', 'control', 'probably', 'end', 'civilization', 'know', 'live', 'strange', 'world', 'child', 'must', 'sacrifice', 'education', 'order', 'protest', 'destruction', 'future', 'worth', 'people', 'contributed', 'least', 'crisis', 'one', 'going', 'affected', 'politician', 'expensive', 'save', 'world', 'spending', 'trillion', 'euro', 'subsidizing', 'fossil', 'fuel', 'live', 'strange', 'world', 'dare', 'look', 'beyond', 'current', 'political', 'system', 'though', 'clear', 'answer', 'seek', 'found', 'within', 'politics', 'today', 'people', 'seem', 'concerned', 'presence', 'school', 'child', 'future', 'humankind', 'everyone', 'choose', 'reality', 'buy', 'truth', 'survival', 'depending', 'small', 'rapidly', 'disappearing', 'carbon', 'budget', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'know', 'exists', 'think', 'buy', 'build', 'way', 'crisis', 'created', 'buying', 'building', 'stuff', 'football', 'game', 'film', 'gala', 'get', 'medium', 'attention', 'biggest', 'crisis', 'humanity', 'ever', 'faced', 'celebrity', 'film', 'pop', 'star', 'stood', 'injustice', 'stand', 'environment', 'climate', 'justice', 'would', 'inflict', 'right', 'fly', 'around', 'world', 'visiting', 'favorite', 'restaurant', 'beach', 'yoga', 'retreat', 'avoiding', 'catastrophic', 'climate', 'breakdown', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'yet', 'here', 'truth', 'cant', 'without', 'audience', 'tonight', 'people', 'see', 'celebrity', 'god', 'influence', 'billion', 'people', 'need', 'use', 'voice', 'raise', 'awareness', 'global', 'crisis', 'help', 'turn', 'individual', 'movement', 'help', 'u', 'wake', 'leader', 'let', 'know', 'house', 'fire', 'live', 'strange', 'world', 'world', 'generation', 'handed', 'world', 'weve', 'got', 'standing', 'crossroad', 'history', 'failing', 'yet', 'failed', 'time', 'fix', 'u', 'thank'];-0.021376463043129706;0.38928571428571435

is on fire and you want to keep your house from burning to the ground then
that does require require some level of panic we are in the midst of the sixth

is considered normal with up to 200 species becoming extinct every single
day erosion of fertile topsoil the deforestation of her great worst toxic air pollution loss of insects and Wildlife the acidification of our oceans
these are all the sorceress trends being accelerated by a way of life that we get
are financially fortunate part of the world sea is all right silly we carry on

acting accordingly because at the moment they are not if our house was falling apart our leaders wouldn't go on like
you do today he would change almost every part of your behavior as he do in an emergency if our house was falling apart you wouldn't hold three emergency
breaks at summers and no emergency summit regarding the breakdown of the clients and

alternatives are certainly less worse than others and I have read that some
parties do not even want me standing here today because they so desperately
do not want to talk about climate breakdown to do your best is no longer
good enough we must all do the seemingly impossible and it's okay if you refuse to listen to me I am after all just a

The World is Waking Up;September 23, 2019 ;"My message is that we'll be watching you.
This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you!
You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I'm one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!
For more than 30 years, the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you're doing enough, when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight.
You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency. But no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that. Because if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil. And that I refuse to believe.
The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50% chance of staying below 1.5 degrees [Celsius], and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control.
Fifty percent may be acceptable to you. But those numbers do not include tipping points, most feedback loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of equity and climate justice. They also rely on my generation sucking hundreds of billions of tons of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist.
So a 50% risk is simply not acceptable to us — we who have to live with the consequences.
To have a 67% chance of staying below a 1.5 degrees global temperature rise – the best odds given by the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] – the world had 420 gigatons of CO2 left to emit back on Jan. 1st, 2018. Today that figure is already down to less than 350 gigatons.
How dare you pretend that this can be solved with just 'business as usual' and some technical solutions? With today's emissions levels, that remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone within less than 8 1/2 years.
There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures here today, because these numbers are too uncomfortable. And you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is.
You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say: We will never forgive you.
We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.

Trust me, I’ve done this before and I can assure you it doesn’t lead to anything. And for the record, when we children tell you to panic, we’re not telling you to go on like before. We’re not telling you to rely on technologies that don’t even exist today at scale and that science says perhaps never will. We are not telling you to keep talking about reaching net zero emissions or carbon neutrality by cheating and fiddling around with numbers.
We’re not telling you to offset your emissions by just paying someone else to plant trees in places like Africa, while at the same time forests like the Amazon are being slaughtered at an infinitely higher rate. Planting trees is good of course, but it’s nowhere near enough of what is needed and it cannot replace real mitigation and rewilding nature. And let’s be clear, we don’t need a low carbon economy, we don’t need to lower emissions. Our emissions have to stop if you are to have a chance to stay below the 1.5 degree target. And until we have the technologies that at scale can put our emissions to minus, then we must forget about net zero we need real zero. Because distant net zero emission targets will mean absolutely nothing if we just continue to ignore the carbon dioxide budget that applies for today, not distant future dates. If high emissions continued like now, even for a few years, that budgets will soon be completely used up.
The fact that the USA is leaving the Paris Accord seem to outrage and worry everyone and it should, but the fact that we are all about to fail the commitments you signed up for in the Paris Agreement doesn’t seem to bother the people in power even the least. Any plan or policy of yours that doesn’t include a radical emission cuts at the source starting today is completely insufficient for meeting the 1.5 or well below two degree commitments of the Paris Agreements.
And again, this is not about right or left, we couldn’t care less about your party politics. From a sustainability perspective, the right the left as well as the center have all failed. No political ideology or economic structure has been able to tackle the climates, an environmental emergency and create the cohesive and sustainable world because of that world in case you haven’t noticed is currently on fire. You say children shouldn’t worry. You say, just leave this to us, we will fix this, we promise we won’t let you down. Don’t be so pessimistic. And then nothing, silence or something worse than silence, empty words and promises which give the impression that sufficient action is being taken.
All the solutions are obviously not available within today’s societies, nor do we have the time to wait for new technological solutions to become available to start drastically reducing our emissions. So of course the transition isn’t going to be easy. It will be hard and unless we start facing this now together with all cards on the table, we won’t be able to solve this in time. In the days running up to the 50th anniversary of the world economic forum, I joined a group of climate activists demanding that you the world’s most powerful and influential business and political leaders begin to take the action needed.
We demand at this year’s World Economic Forum, participants from all companies, banks, institutions and governments immediately hold all investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction, immediately end all fossil fuel subsidies and immediately and completely divest from fossil fuels. We don’t want these things done by 2050 or 2030 or even 2021 we want this done now. It may seem like we are asking for a lots and you will of course say that we are naive, but this is just the very minimum amount of effort that is needed to start the rapid sustainable transition. So either you do this or you’re going to have to explain to your children why you are giving up on the 1.5 degree target giving up without even trying.
Well, I’m here to tell you that unlike you, my generation will not give up without a fight. The facts are clear but they are still too uncomfortable for you to address. You just leave it because you just think it’s too depressing and people will give up. The people will not give up. You are the ones who are giving up. Last week I met with Polish coal miners who lost their jobs because their mind was closed and even they had not given up. On the country they seem to understand the fact that we need to change more than you do. I wonder what will you tell your children was the reason to fail and leave them facing a climate chaos that you knowingly brought upon them? That it seems so bad for the economy that we decided to resign the idea of securing future living conditions without even trying. Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fueling the flames by the hour, and we are telling you to act as if you loved your children above all else.
