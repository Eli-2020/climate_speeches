Our Lives Are In Your Hands ;Climate Strike Concert;Stockholm;September 8,2018;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrGp56ViaJs;https://medium.com/wedonthavetime/greta-thunberg-our-lives-are-in-your-hands-b5a7b1e24a97;"Last summer, climate scientist Johan Rockström and some other people wrote that we have at most three years to reverse growth in greenhouse-gas emissions if we’re going to reach the goals set in the Paris agreement.
Over a year and two months have now passed, and in that time many other scientists have said the same thing and a lot of things have got worse and greenhouse-gas emissions continue to increase. So maybe we have even less time than the one year and ten months Johan Rockström said we have left.
If people knew this they wouldn’t need to ask me why I’m so 'passionate about climate change.'
If people knew that the scientists say that we have a five percent chance of meeting the Paris target, and if people knew what a nightmare scenario we will face if we don’t keep global warming below 2 °C, they wouldn’t need to ask me why I’m on school strike outside parliament.
Because if everyone knew how serious the situation is and how little is actually being done, everyone would come and sit down beside us.
In Sweden, we live our lives as if we had the resources of 4.2 planets. Our carbon footprint is one of the ten worst in the world. This means that Sweden steals 3.2 years of natural resources from future generations every year. Those of us who are part of these future generations would like Sweden to stop doing that.
Right now.
This is not a political text. Our school strike has nothing to do with party politics.
Because the climate and the biosphere don’t care about our politics and our empty words for a single second.
They only care about what we actually do.
This is a cry for help.
To all the newspapers who still don’t write about and report on climate change even though they said that the climate was “the critical question of our time” when the Swedish forests were burning this summer.
To all of you who have never treated this crisis as a crisis.
To all the influencers who stand up for everything except the climate and the environment.
To all the political parties that pretend to take the climate question seriously.
To all the politicians that ridicule us on social media, and have named and shamed me so that people tell me that I’m retarded, a bitch and a terrorist, and many other things.
To all of you who choose to look the other way every day because you seem more frightened of the changes that can prevent catastrophic climate change than the catastrophic climate change itself.
Your silence is almost worst of all.
The future of all the coming generations rests on your shoulder.
Those of us who are still children can’t change what you do now once we’re old enough to do something about it.
A lot of people say that Sweden is a small country, that it doesn’t matter what we do. But I think that if a few girls can get headlines all over the world just by not going to school for a few weeks, imagine what we could do together if we wanted to.
Every single person counts.
Just like every single emission counts.
Every single kilo.
Everything counts.
So please, treat the climate crisis like the acute crisis it is and give us a future.
Our lives are in your hands."
Almost Everything is Black and White;Extinction Rebellion Rally;London;October 31,2018;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8prVarP-rQ&t=30s;https://medium.com/wedonthavetime/the-rebellion-has-begun-d1bffe31d3b5;"When I was about eight years old, I first heard about something called climate change, or global warming. Apparently, that was something humans had created by our way of living. I was told to turn off the lights to save energy and to recycle paper to save resources.
I remember thinking that it was very strange, that humans who are an animal species among others, could be capable of changing the earth's climate. Because, if we were and if it was really happening, we wouldn’t be talking about anything else. As soon as you turned on the TV, everything would be about that. Headlines, radio, newspapers. You would never read or hear about anything else. As if there was a world war going on.
But. No one never talked about it.
If burning fossil fuels was so bad, that it threatened our very existence, how could we just continue like before? Why were there no restrictions? Why wasn’t it made illegal?
To me, that did not add up. It was too unreal.
I have Asperger's syndrome, and to me, almost everything is black or white.
I think in many ways that we autistic are the normal ones and the rest of the people are pretty strange. They keep saying that climate change is an existential threat and the most important issue of all. And yet they just carry on like before. If the emissions have to stop then we must stop the emissions. To me, that is black or white. There are no grey areas when it comes to survival. Either we go on as a civilization or we don’t. We have to change.
Countries like Sweden and the UK need to start reducing emissions by at least 15% every year. And that is so that we can stay below a 2-degree warming target. Now the IPCC says that we have to aim for 1,5 degrees. So we can only imagine what that means. You would think every one of our leaders and the media would be talking about nothing else — but no one ever mentions it. Nor does anyone ever mention anything about the greenhouse gases already locked in the system, nor that air pollution is hiding a warming, so when we stop burning fossil fuels, we already have an extra 0,5 to 1,1 degrees celsius guaranteed.
Nor does hardly anyone ever mention that we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction, with about 200 species going extinct every single day.
Furthermore, does no one ever speak about the aspect of equity, or climate justice, clearly stated everywhere in the Paris agreement and the Kyoto protocol, which is absolutely necessary to make the Paris agreement work, on a global scale. That means that rich countries need to get down to zero emissions, within 6–12 years, so that people in poorer countries can heighten their standard of living by building some of the infrastructures that we have already built. Such as roads, hospitals, electricity, schools, and clean drinking water. Because how can we expect countries like India or Nigeria to care about the climate crisis if we, who already have everything, don’t care even a second about it or our actual commitments to the Paris agreement?
So, why are we not reducing our emissions? Why are they, in fact, still increasing? Are we knowingly causing a mass extinction? Are we evil?
No, of course not. People keep doing what they do because the vast majority doesn’t have a clue about the consequences of our everyday life. And they don’t know the rapid changes required.
Since, as I said before, no one talks about it. There are no headlines, no emergency meetings, no breaking news. No one is acting as if we were in a crisis. Even most green politicians and climate scientists go on flying around the world, eating meat and dairy.
If I live to be 100 I will be alive in the year 2103.
When you think about “the future” today, you don’t think beyond the year 2050. By then I will, in the best case, not even have lived half of my life. What happens next?
The year 2078 I will celebrate my 75th birthday.
What we do or don’t do, right now, will affect my entire life, and the lives of my children and grandchildren.
When school started in August this year I decided that this was enough. I sat myself down on the ground outside the Swedish parliament. I school strikes for the climate.
Some people say that I should be in school instead. Some people say that I should study to become a climate scientist so that I can ”solve the climate crisis”. But the climate crisis has already been solved. We already have all the facts and solutions. All we have to do is to wake up and change.
And why should I be studying for a future that soon will be no more, when no one is doing anything whatsoever to save that future? And what is the point of learning facts within the school system when the most important facts given by the finest science of that same school system clearly means nothing to our politicians and our society?
A lot of people say that Sweden is just a small country and that it doesn’t matter what we do. But I think that if a few children can get headlines all over the world just by not going to school for a few weeks, imagine what we all could do together if we wanted to.
Today we use 100 million barrels of oil every day. There are no politics to change that. There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground.
So we can’t save the world by playing by the rules. Because the rules have to be changed.
Everything needs to change. And it has to start today.
So everyone out there, it is now time for civil disobedience, it is time to rebel."
Save the World by Changing the Rules;School strike for climate;Stockholm;November 24, 2018;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAmmUIEsN9A;https://fridaysforfuture.org/what-we-do/activist-speeches/#greta_speech_tedx;"When I was about eight years old,

If burning fossil fuels was so bad that it threatened our very existence, how could we just continue like before?
Why were there no restrictions?
Why wasn't it made illegal?
To me, that did not add up.
It was too unreal.
So when I was 11, I became ill.
I fell into depression, I stopped talking, and I stopped eating.
In two months, I lost about 10 kilos of weight.
Later on, I was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, OCD and selective mutism.
That basically means I only speak when I think it's necessary - now is one of those moments.
(Applause)
For those of us who are on the spectrum, almost everything is black or white.
We aren't very good at lying, and we usually don't enjoy participating in this social game that the rest of you seem so fond of.
(Laughter)
I think in many ways that we autistic are the normal ones,and the rest of the people are pretty strange,
(Laughter)
especially when it comes to the sustainability crisis, where everyone keeps saying climate change is an existential threat and the most important issue of all, and yet they just carry on like before.
I don't understand that, because if the emissions have to stop, then we must stop the emissions.
To me that is black or white.There are no gray areas when it comes to survival.
Either we go on as a civilization or we don't.We have to change.
Rich countries like Sweden need to start reducing emissions by at least 15 percent every year.
And that is so that we can stay below a two-degree warming target.
Yet, as the IPCC have recently demonstrated, aiming instead for 1.5 degrees Celsius would significantly reduce the climate impacts.
But we can only imagine what that means for reducing emissions.
You would think the media and every one of our leaders would be talking about nothing else, but they never even mention it.
Nor does anyone ever mention the greenhouse gases already locked in the system.
Nor that air pollution is hiding a warming so that when we stop burning fossil fuels, we already have an extra level of warming perhaps as high as 0.5 to 1.1 degrees Celsius.
Furthermore does hardly anyone speak about the fact that we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction,with up to 200 species going extinct every single day,that the extinction rate today is between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than what is seen as normal.
Nor does hardly anyone ever speak about the aspect of equity or climate justice,clearly stated everywhere in the Paris Agreement,which is absolutely necessary to make it work on a global scale.
That means that rich countries need to get down to zero emissions within 6 to 12 years,with today's emission speed.
And that is so that people in poorer countries can have a chance to heighten their standard of living
by building some of the infrastructure that we have already built,such as roads, schools, hospitals, clean drinking water, electricity, and so on.
Because how can we expect countries like India or Nigeria to care about the climate crisis if we who already have everything don't care even a second about it
or our actual commitments to the Paris Agreement?
So, why are we not reducing our emissions?
Why are they in fact still increasing?
Are we knowingly causing a mass extinction?
Are we evil?
No, of course not.
People keep doing what they do because the vast majority doesn't have a clue about the actual consequences of our everyday life,and they don't know that rapid change is required.
We all think we know, and we all think everybody knows,but we don't.
Because how could we?
If there really was a crisis,and if this crisis was caused by our emissions, you would at least see some signs.
Not just flooded cities, tens of thousands of dead people,and whole nations leveled to piles of torn down buildings.
You would see some restrictions.
But no.
And no one talks about it.
There are no emergency meetings, no headlines, no breaking news.
No one is acting as if we were in a crisis.
Even most climate scientists or green politicians
keep on flying around the world, eating meat and dairy.
If I live to be 100, I will be alive in the year 2103.
When you think about the future today, you don't think beyond the year 2050.
By then, I will, in the best case, not even have lived half of my life.
What happens next?
The year 2078, I will celebrate my 75th birthday.
If I have children or grandchildren, maybe they will spend that day with me.
Maybe they will ask me about you,
the people who were around, back in 2018.
Maybe they will ask why you didn't do anything while there still was time to act.
What we do or don't do right now will affect my entire life and the lives of my children and grandchildren.
What we do or don't do right now, me and my generation can't undo in the future.
So when school started in August of this year,I decided that this was enough.
I set myself down on the ground outside the Swedish parliament.
I school striked for the climate.
Some people say that I should be in school instead. Some people say that I should study to become a climate scientist so that I can solve the climate crisis.But the climate crisis has already been solved.We already have all the facts and solutions.

just by not coming to school for a few weeks,imagine what we could all do together if you wanted to.
(Applause)
Now we're almost at the end of my talk,and this is where people usually start talking about hope,solar panels, wind power, circular economy, and so on,but I'm not going to do that.
We've had 30 years of pep-talking and selling positive ideas.
And I'm sorry, but it doesn't work.
Because if it would have,the emissions would have gone down by now.
They haven't.
And yes, we do need hope,of course we do.
But the one thing we need more than hope is action.
Once we start to act, hope is everywhere.
So instead of looking for hope,look for action.
Then, and only then, hope will come.
Today, we use 100 million barrels of oil every single day.
There are no politics to change that.
There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground.
So we can't save the world by playing by the rules,because the rules have to be changed.
Everything needs to change,and it has to start today.
Thank you."
Our Political Leaders Have Failed Us;UN Climate Conference;Katowice;December 3, 2018;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7NEcbPSak4;https://fridaysforfuture.org/what-we-do/activist-speeches/#greta_speech_jan22_2019;"before I start I just want to thank you
Antonio Guterres for speaking so clearly about the climate crisis. it brings a lot of hope to people.
for 25 years countless of people have stood in front of the United Nations climate conferences asking our nation's leaders to stop the
emissions, but clearly this has not worked since the emissions just continue to rise.
so I will not ask them anything.
instead I will ask the people around the world to realize that our political leaders have failed us because we are facing an existential threat and there
is no time to continue down this road of madness.
rich countries like Sweden need to start reducing emissions by at least 15 percent every year to stay below a two degree warming target.
you would think the media and every one of our leaders will be talking about nothing else but they never even mention it.
Nor does hardly anyone ever mentioned that we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction with up to 200 species going  extinct every single day. 
furthermore, does no-one ever speak about the aspect of equity clearly stated in the Paris agreement which is absolutely necessary to make it work on a global scale.
that means that rich countries like mine, need to get down to zero emissions within six to twelve years with today's emission speed.
because how can we expect countries like India, Colombia or Nigeria to care about the climate crisis if we who already have everything don't care even a second about our actual commitments to the Paris agreement.
so when school started in August of this year, I sat myself down on the ground outside the Swedish parliament.
I school striked for the climate.
some people say that I should be in school instead.
some people say that I should have studied to become a climate scientist so that I can solve the climate crisis.
but the climate crisis has already been solved. we already have all the facts and solutions. 
and why should I be studying for a future that soon may be no more?
when no one is doing anything to save that future. and what is the point of learning facts, when the most important facts clearly means nothing to our society.
today, we use 100 million barrels of oil every single day. 
there are no politics to change that.
there are no rules to keep that oil in the ground.
so we can no longer save the world by playing by the rules because the rules have to be changed.
so we have not come here to beg the world leaders to care for our future.
they have ignored us in the past and they will ignore us again.
we have come here to let them know that change is coming whether they like it or not.
the people will rise to the challenge and since our leaders are behaving like children we will have to take the responsibility they should have taken long ago. Thank you"
Unpopular;COP24 Speech;Katowice;December 12, 2018;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcQp_l7WqAk&t=46s;https://fridaysforfuture.org/what-we-do/activist-speeches/#greta_speech_jan22_2019;"My name is Greta Thunberg. I am 15 years old and I'm from Sweden.I speak on behalf of Climate Justice Now. Many people say that Sweden is just a small country, and it doesn't matter what we do, but I've learned that you are never too small to make a difference, and if a few children can get headlines all over the world just by not going to school, then imagine what we could all do
together if we really wanted to. But to do that we have to speak clearly, no matter how uncomfortable that may be. You only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular. You only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake. You are not mature enough to tell it like it is, even that burden you leave to us children, but I don't care about being popular. I care about climate justice and the living planet. Our civilisation is being sacrificed for the opportunity of a very
small number of people to continue making enormous amounts of money.
Our biosphere is being sacrificed so that rich people in countries like mine can live in luxury. It is the sufferings of the many which pay for the luxuries of the few. In the year 2078, I will celebrate my 75th birthday. If I have children maybe they will spend that day with me, maybe they will ask me about you.
Maybe they will ask why you didn't do anything, while there still was time to act. You say you love your children above all else, and yet you're stealing their future in front of their very eyes. Until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible, there is no hope. We cannot solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis. We need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground and we need to focus on equity. And if solutions within this system are so impossible to find then maybe we should change the system itself.
We have not come here to beg world leaders to care, you have ignored us in the past and you will ignore us again. We have run out of excuses and we are running out of time. We have come here to let you know that change is coming whether you like it or not. The real power belongs to the people. Thank you."
Our House is On Fire;World Economic Forum;Davos;January 25, 2019 ;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3dtXewdDSg&t=5s;https://www.environmentshow.com/greta-thunberg-speeches/;"our house is on fire. I am here to say, our house is on fire according to the IPCC.
we are less than 12 years away from not being able to undo our mistakes. in that time, unprecedented changes in all
aspects of society needs to have taken place including a reduction of our co2 emissions by at least 50%.
and please note that those numbers do not include the aspect of equity, which is absolutely necessary to make the Paris agreement work on a global scale.
nor does it include tipping points or feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas being released from the thawing Arctic permafrost.
at places like davos, people like to tell success stories. but their financial success has come with an unthinkable price tag. and on climate
change, we have to acknowledge that we have failed.
all political movements in their present form have done so. and the media has failed to create broad public awareness.
but Homo sapiens have not yet failed. yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around. we can still fix this. we still have everything in our own hands.
but unless we recognize the overall failures of our current systems we must probably those probably don't stand a chance.
we are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. and now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. now it's the time to speak clearly.
solving the client crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that Homo sapiens has have ever faced. the main solution, however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it.
we have to stop the emissions of greenhouse gases.
and either we do that or we don't.
you say nothing in life is black or white. but that is a lie. a very dangerous lie. either we prevent a 1.5 degree of warming or we don't.
either we avoid setting off that if irreversible chain reaction beyond the human control or we don't.
either we choose to go on as I civilization we don't.
That is as black ice as it gets.
there are no gray areas when it comes to survival.
now we all have a choice.
we can create transformational action that will safeguard the future living conditions for humankind. 
we can continue with our business as usual and fail then it's up to you and
me so say that we should not engage in activism instead we should leave everything to our politicians and just
vote for change instead but what do we do when there is no political will what do we do when the politics needn't are nowhere in sight?
here in Davos just like everywhere else everyone is talking about money. 
it seems that money and growth are our only main concerns.
and since the climate crisis is a crisis that has never once has been treated as a crisis, people are simply not aware of the full consequences of our everyday life. people are not aware that there is such a thing
as a carbon budget and just how incredible small that remaining carbon budget is and that needs to change today.
no other current challenge can match the importance of establishing a wide public awareness and understanding of our rapidly disappearing carbon budgets that should and must become a new global currency in the very heart of future and present economics.
we are now at a time in history where everyone with any insight of the climate crisis that threatens our civilization and the entire biosphere must speak out. in clear language.
no matter how uncomfortable and unprofitable that may be.
we must change almost everything in our current societies the bigger your carbon footprint is the bigger your more Duty
the bigger your platform the bigger your responsibility.
adults keep saying: 'we owe it to the young people to give them hope' but I don't want your hope. I don't want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic.
I want you to feel the fair I feel every day. and then I want you to act. I want you to act as if you would in a crisis. I wanted to act as if the house was on fire because it is"
You are Acting Like Spoiled Irresponsible Children;European Economic and Social Committee;Brussels;February 21, 2019 ;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVeYOPJZ8oc;https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/news-media/videos/youre-acting-spoiled-irresponsible-children-speech-greta-thunberg-climate-activist;"My name is Greta Thunberg, I am a climate activist from Sweden and today in this room there are also - if you can come up - Anuna, Adélaïde, Kyra, Gilles, Dries, Toon and Luisa.
Tens of thousands of children or schools are striking for the climate on the streets of Brussels. Hundreds of thousands are doing the same all over the world. We are school striking because we have done our homework. And some of us are here today. People always tell us that they are so hopeful. They are hopeful that the young people are going to save the world, but we are not. There is simply not enough time to wait for us to grow up and become the ones in charge. Because by the year 2020 we need to have bended the emissions curve steep downward.
That is next year. We know that most politicians don't want to talk to us. Good, we don't want to talk to them either. We want them to talk to the scientists instead. Listen to them, because we are just repeating what they are saying and have been saying for decades. We want you to follow the Paris agreement and the IPCC reports. We don't have any other manifests or demands, you unite behind the science that is our demand. When many politicians talk about the school strike for the climate, they talk about almost anything except for the climate crisis.
Many people are trying to make the school strikes a question of whether we are promoting truancy or whether we should go back to school or not. They make up all sorts of conspiracies and call us puppets who cannot think for ourselves. They are desperately trying to remove the focus from the climate crisis and change the subject. They don't want to talk about it because they know they cannot win this fight. Because they know they haven't done their homework, but we have. Once you have done your homework you realize that we need new politics, we need new economics where everything is based on a rapidly declining and extremely limited remaining carbon budget.
But that is not enough. We need a whole new way of thinking. The political system that you have created is all about competition. You cheat when you can, because all that matters is to win, to get power. That must come to an end, we must stop competing with each other, we need to cooperate and work together and to share the resources of the planet in a fair way. We need to start living within the planetary boundaries, focus on equity and take a few steps back for the sake of all living species. We need to protect the biosphere, the air, the oceans, the soil, the forests.
This may sound very naive, but if you have done your homework then you know that we don't have any other choice. We need to focus every inch of our being on climate change, because if we fail to do so than all our achievements and progress have been for nothing and all that will remain of our political leaders’ legacy will be the greatest failure of human history. And they will be remembered as the greatest villains of all time, because they have chosen not to listen and not to act. But this does not have to be. There is still time. According to the IPCC report we are about 11 years away from being in a position where we set off an irreversible chain reaction beyond human control.
To avoid that unprecedented changes in all aspects of society, [actions] need to have taken place within this coming decade, including a reduction of our CO2 emissions by at least 50 percent by the year 2030. And please note that those numbers do not include the aspect of equity, which is absolutely necessary to make the Paris agreement work on a global scale, nor do they include tipping points or feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas released from the thawing Arctic permafrost. They do, however, include negative emission techniques on a huge planetary scale that is yet to be invented, and that many scientists fear will never be ready in time and will anyway be impossible to deliver at the scale assumed. 
We have been told that the EU intends to improve its emission reduction targets. In the new target, the EU is proposing to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 45 percent below 1990’s level by 2030. 
Some people say that is good or that is ambitious. But this new target is still not enough to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.
This target is not sufficient to protect the future for children growing up today. If the EU is to make its fair contribution to staying within the carbon budget for the two-degree limit, then it means a minimum of 80 percent reduction by 2030 and that includes aviation and shipping. So [it is] around twice as ambitious as the current proposal. The actions required are beyond manifestos or any party politics. Once again, they sweep their mess under the carpet for our generation to clean up and solve. Some people say that we are fighting for our future, but that is not true. We are not fighting for our future, we are fighting for everyone's future. And if you think that we should be in school instead, then we suggest that you take our place in the streets striking from your work. Or better yet, join us so it can speed up the process.
And I am sorry, but saying everything will be alright while continue doing nothing at all is just not hopeful to us. In fact, it's the opposite of hope. And yet this is exactly what you keep doing. You can't just sit around waiting for hope to come, you're acting like spoiled irresponsible children. You don't seem to understand that hope is something you have to earn. And if you still say that we are wasting valuable lesson time then let me remind you that our political leaders have wasted decades through denial and inaction. And since our time is running out we have decided to take action. We have started to clean up your mess and we will not stop until we are done."
A Strange World;Goldene Kamera;Berlin;March 30, 2019;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFvXc14g3AQ;https://www.environmentshow.com/greta-thunberg-speeches/;"thank you. I want to dedicate this prize to those protecting the Hambach forests and to the climate activists who fight to keep the fossil fuels in the ground everywhere.
we live in a strange world, where the United science tells us that we are about 11 years away from setting off an irreversible chain reaction, way beyond
human control that will probably be the end of our civilization as we know it.
we live in a strange world where children must sacrifice their education in order to protest against the destruction of their future. 
worth of people who have contributed the least to this crisis are the ones who are going to be affected the most, where politicians say it's too expensive to save the world while spending trillions of euros subsidizing fossil fuels.
we live in a strange world where no one dares to look beyond our current political systems even though it's clear that the answers we seek will not be found within the politics of today.
where some people seem to be more concerned about the presence in school of some children than the future of humankind.
where everyone can choose their own reality and buy their own truth, where our survival is depending on a small rapidly disappearing carbon budget and hardly anyone even knows it exists where we think we can buy and build our way out of a crisis that has been created by buying and building stuff.
we're a football game or a film gala gets more media attention than the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced.
we're celebrities film and pop stars who have stood up against all injustice will not stand up for the environment and for climate justice because that would inflict on their right to fly around the
world visiting their favorite restaurants beaches and yoga retreats.
avoiding catastrophic climate breakdown is to do the seemingly impossible and yet that is what we have to do, but here's the truth we can't do it without you in the audience here tonight people
see you celebrities as gods you influence billions of people we need you, you can use your voice to raise awareness about this global crisis, you can help turn individuals into movements you can help us wake up the leaders and
let them know that our house is on fire.
we live in a strange world but it's the world that my generation has been handed it's the only world we've got. we are now standing at a crossroads in history we are failing but we have not yet failed there is still time and to fix this it's up to us. thank you."
Cathedral Thinking;European Parliament;Strasbourg;April 16, 2019;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWsM9-_zrKo;https://www.europarl.europa.eu/resources/library/media/20190416RES41665/20190416RES41665.pdf;"My name is Greta Thunberg. I am 16 years old. I come from from Sweden and I want you to panic.
I want you to act as if your house was on fire.
I have said those words before And a lot of people has explained why that is a bad idea.
A great number of politicians have told me that panic never leads to anything good.
And I agree.
To panic unless you have to is a terrible idea.
But when your house is on fire and you want to keep your house from burning to the ground, then that does require some level of panic.
Our civilization is so fragile. It is almost like a castle built in the sand.
The facade is so beautiful. But the foundations are far from solid.
We have been cutting so many corners.
Yesterday the world watched with despair and enormous sorrow how the Notre Dame burnt in Paris.
Some buildings are much more than just buildings.
But the Notre Dame will be rebuilt.
I hope that it’s foundations are strong.
I hope that our foundations are even stronger.
But I fear that they are not.
Around the year 2030. 10 years 259 days and 10 hours way from now. We will be in a position where we set off an irreversible chain reaction beyond human control, that will most likely lead to the end of our civilization as we know it.
That is unless in that time, permanent and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society have taken place. Including a reduction of CO2 emissions by at least 50%.
Andplease note that these calculations are depending on inventions that have not yet been invented at scale, inventions that are supposed to clear our atmosphere of astronomical amounts of carbon dioxide.
Furthermore do these calculations not include unforeseen tipping points and feed back loops like the extremely powerful methane gas escaping from rapidly thawing arctic permafrost.
Nor do they include already locked in warming hidden by air pollution. Nor the aspect of equity - or climate justice - clearly stated throughout the Paris Agreement, which is
absolutely necessary to make it work on a global scale.
We must also bear in mind that these are just calculations. Estimations. That means that these 'points of no return' may occur a bit sooner or later than 2030. No one can know for sure.
We can however be certain that they will occur approximately in these time frames.
Because these calculations are not opinions or wild guesses.
These projections are backed up by scientific facts, concluded by all nations through the IPCC. 
Nearly every major national scientific body around the world unreservedly supports the work and findings of the IPCC.
We are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction and the extinction rate is up to ten thousand times faster than what is considered normal, with up to 200 species becoming extinct every single day.
Erosion of fertile topsoil, deforestation of our great forests, toxic air pollution, loss of insects and wildlife, the acidification of our oceans - these are all disastrous trends being accelerated by a way of life that we, here in our financially-fortunate part of the world, see as our right to simply carry on.
But hardly anyone knows about these catastrophes - or understand how they are just the first few symptoms of climate- and ecological breakdown.
Because how could they? They have not been told. Or more importantly: they have not been told by the right people - and in the right way.
Our house is falling apart.
And our leaders need to start acting accordingly.
Because at the moment they are not.
If our house was falling apart our leaders wouldn’t go on like you do today.
You would change almost every part of your behavior. As you do in an emergency.
If our house was falling apart you wouldn’t fly around the world in business class chatting about how the market will solve everything with clever small solutions to specific isolated
problems.
You wouldn’t talk about buying and building your way out of a crisis that has been created by buying and building things.
If our house was falling apart you wouldn’t hold 3 emergency Brexit summits and no emergency summit regarding the breakdown of the climate and eco systems.
You wouldn’t be arguing about phasing out coal in 15 or 11 years.
If our house was falling apart you wouldn’t be celebrating that one single nation like Ireland may soon divest from fossil fuels.
You wouldn’t celebrate that Norway has decided to stop drilling for oil outside the scenic resort of Lofoten Island, but will continue to drill everywhere else for decades.
It’s 30 years too late for that kind of celebrations If our house was falling apart the media wouldn’t be writing about anything else. 
The ongoing climate- and ecological crises would make up all the headlines.
If our house was falling apart you wouldn’t say that you have the situation under control and place the future living conditions for all living species in the hands of inventions that are yet to be invented.
And you would not spend all your time as politicians arguing over taxes or Brexit.
If the walls of our house truly came tumbling down, surely you would set your differences aside and start cooperating.
Well, our house is falling apart.
And we are rapidly running out of time.
And, yet basically nothing is happening.
Everyone and everything has to change so why waste precious time arguing about what and who needs to change first?
Everyone and everything has to change. But the bigger your platform the bigger your responsibility.
The bigger your carbon footprint the bigger your moral duty.
When I tell politicians to act now the most common answer is that they can’t do anything drastic, because that would be too unpopular among voters.
And they are right of course. Since most people are not even aware of why those changes are required. That is why I keep telling you to unite behind the science - make the best available science the heart of politics and democracy.
The EU elections are coming up soon. And many of us who will be affected the most by this crisis, people like me, are not allowed to vote. Nor are we in a position to shape the
decisions of business, politics, engineering, media, education or science. Because the time it takes for us to educate ourselves to do that simply does no longer exists.
And that is why millions of children are taking it to the streets, school striking for the climate to create attention for the climate crisis. 
You need to listen to us - we who cannot vote. You need to vote for us, for your children and grandchildren.
What we are doing now can soon no longer be undone.
In this election you vote for the future living conditions of human kind.
And though the politics needed do not exist today, some alternatives are certainly less worse than others. And I have read in newspapers that some parties do not even want me standing here today because they so desperate do not to talk about climate breakdown.
Our house is falling part.
The future - as well as all that we have achieved in the past - is literally in your hands now.
But it is not too late to act.
It will take a far-reaching vision. It will take courage. It will take a fierce determination to act now to lay the foundations when we may not know all of the details about how to shape the ceiling. 
In other words, it will take ‘cathedral thinking’.
I ask you to please wake up and make the required changes possible.
To do your best is no longer good enough. We must all do the seemingly impossible.
And it’s okay if you refuse to listen to me. I am after all just a 16 year-old schoolgirl from from Sweden.
But you can not ignore the scientists. Or the science. Or the millions of schoolchildren school striking for the right to a future."
You Can’t Simply Make Up Your Own Facts;Frech National Assembly;Paris;July 23, 2019;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1yimNdqhqE;https://awpc.cattcenter.iastate.edu/2019/12/02/speech-at-the-national-assembly-in-paris-july-23-2019/;"je m'appelle greta thunber, merci beaucoup pour l'invitation. 
Thank you all for coming here.
I have some good news and some bad news regarding the climate emergency. I will start with the good news.
The world, as a small number of people have been saying lately, will not end in 11 years.
The bad news, however, is that around the year 2030, if we continue with business as usual, we will likely be in a position where we may pass a number of tipping points. 
And then we might no longer be able to undo the irreversible climate breakdown.
A lot of people, a lot of politicians, business leaders, journalists, say they don't agree with what we are saying. They say we children are exaggerating, that we are alarmists. To answer this I would like to refer to page 108, chapter 2 in the latest IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate] report. 
There you will find all our 'opinions' summarized, because there you find a remaining carbon dioxide budget. Right there it says that if we are to have a sixty-seven percent chance of limiting the global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees, we had on January 1, 2018, 420 gigatons of carbon dioxide left in our CO2 budget. 
And of course that number is much lower today. We emit about 42 gigatons of CO2 every year. At current emissions levels, that remaining budget is gone within roughly eight and a half years. These numbers are as real as it gets. 
Though a great number of scientists suggests that they are too generous, these are the ones that have been accepted by all nations through the IPCC.
And not once, not one single time have I heard any politician, journalist or business leader even mention these numbers. It is almost like you don't even know they exist, as if you haven't even read the latest IPCC reports on which the future of our civilization is depending.
Or maybe you are simply not mature enough to tell it like it is. Because even that burden you leave to us children. We become the bad guys who have to tell people these uncomfortable things, because no one else wants to or dares to. And just for quoting and acting on these numbers, these scientific facts, we receive unimaginable amounts of hate and threats. We are being mocked and lied about by elected officials, members of parliaments, business leaders, journalists. What I really would like to ask all of those who question our so-called 'opinions' or think that we are extreme: Do you have a different budget for at least a reasonable chance of staying below the 1.5 degrees of warming limit? Is there another intergovernmental panel on climate change? Is there a secret Paris agreement that we don't know about? One that not [does not include] the aspect of equity? Because these are the numbers that count, this is the current best available science. You can't simply make up your own facts just because you don't like what you hear.
There is no middle ground when it comes to the climate and ecological emergency. Of course you could argue that we should go for a more risky pathway, such as the alternative of 580 gigatons of CO2 from January 1, 2018, which gives us a 50/50 percent chance of limiting the global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees. That amount of carbon dioxide will run out in about 12 years of current business as usual. But why should we do that, why should we accept taking that risk, leaving the future living conditions for humankind to a 50/50 flip of a coin?
Four hundred twenty gigatons left of CO2 to emit. And now that number is down to less than 360 gigatons. And please note that these figures are global and therefore do not say anything about the aspect of equity, clearly stated throughout the Paris agreement, which is absolutely necessary to make it work on a global scale. That means that richer countries need to get down to zero emissions faster, so the people in poorer parts of the world can heighten their standard of living by building some of the infrastructure that we have already built, such as roads, hospitals, electricity, schools and providing clean drinking water.
And because you have ignored these facts, because you and pretty much all of the media to this very minute, keep ignoring them, people do not know what is going on. If you respect the science, if you understand the science, then this is it. Four hundred twenty gigatons of CO2 left to emit on January 1 to have a sixty-seven percent chance of staying below a 1.5 degrees of global temperature rise, according to the IPCC.
In the Paris agreement we have only signed up for staying below 1.5 to 2 degrees of temperature rise. And that of course gives us a bigger remaining carbon dioxide budget. But the latest IPCC report shows that aiming instead for below 1.5 degrees would significantly reduce the climate impacts, and that would most certainly save countless of human lives.
This is what it's all about, this is all that we are saying. But I will also tell you this: You cannot solve the crisis without treating it as a crisis, without seeing the full picture. You cannot leave the responsibility to individuals, politicians, the market or other parts of the world to take. This has to include everything and everyone.
Once you realize how painfully small the size of our remaining carbon dioxide budget is, once you realize how fast it is disappearing, once you realize that basically nothing is being done about it and once you realize that almost no one is even aware of the fact that carbon dioxide budgets even exists, then tell me what exactly do you do? And how do we do it without sounding alarmist? That is the question we must ask ourselves, and the people in power.
The science is clear and all we children are doing is communicating and acting on that united science.
Now political leaders in some countries are starting to talk. They are starting to declare climate emergencies and announcing dates for so-called climate neutrality. And declaring a climate emergency is good. But only setting up these vague, distant dates and saying things which give the impression of that things are being done and that action is on the way, will most likely do more harm than good. Because of the changes required are still nowhere in sight. Not in France, not in the EU, nowhere. And I believe that the biggest danger is not our inaction. The real danger is when companies and politicians are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done, apart from clever accounting and creative PR.
The climate and ecological emergency is right here, right now. But it has only just begun, it will get worse. Four hundred twenty gigatons of CO2 left to emit on January 1, 2018, to have a 67 percent chance of staying below a 1.5 degrees of global temperature rise. And now that figure is already down to less than 360 gigatons.
At current emissions levels that remaining budget is gone within roughly eight and a half years. In fact, since I started this speech the world has emitted about 800,000 tons of carbon dioxide. And if anyone still has excuses not to listen, not to act, not to care, I ask you once again: Is there another Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change? Is there a secret Paris agreement that we don't know about? One that does not include the aspect of equity? Do you have a different budget for at least a reasonable chance of staying below 1.5 degrees of global temperature rise?
Some people have chosen not to come here today. Some people have chosen not to listen to us. And that is fine, we are after all just children. You don't have to listen to us, but you do have to listen to the united science, the scientists. And that is all we ask, just unite behind the science! Merci"
Wherever I Go I Seem to be Surrounded by Fairy Tales;U.S. Congress;Washington;September 18, 2019;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxuoOTsYpw8;https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/greta-thunberg-congress-speech-climate-change-crisis-dream-a9112151.html;"My name is Greta Thunberg, I am 16 years old and I’m from Sweden. I am grateful for being with you here in the USA. A nation that, to many people, is the country of dreams.
I also have a dream: that governments, political parties and corporations grasp the urgency of the climate and ecological crisis and come together despite their differences – as you would in an emergency – and take the measures required to safeguard the conditions for a dignified life for everybody on earth.
Because then – we millions of school striking youth – could go back to school.
I have a dream that the people in power, as well as the media, start treating this crisis like the existential emergency it is. So that I could go home to my sister and my dogs. Because I miss them.
In fact I have many dreams. But this is the year 2019. This is not the time and place for dreams. This is the time to wake up. This is the moment in history when we need to be wide awake.
And yes, we need dreams, we can not live without dreams. But there’s a time and place for everything. And dreams can not stand in the way of telling it like it is.
And yet, wherever I go I seem to be surrounded by fairytales. Business leaders, elected officials all across the political spectrum spending their time making up and telling bedtime stories that soothe us, that make us go back to sleep.
These are 'feel-good' stories about how we are going to fix everything. How wonderful everything is going to be when we have 'solved' everything. But the problem we are facing is not that we lack the ability to dream, or to imagine a better world. The problem now is that we need to wake up. It’s time to face the reality, the facts, the science.
And the science doesn’t mainly speak of 'great opportunities to create the society we always wanted'. It tells of unspoken human sufferings, which will get worse and worse the longer we delay action – unless we start to act now. And yes, of course a sustainable transformed world will include lots of new benefits. But you have to understand. This is not primarily an opportunity to create new green jobs, new businesses or green economic growth. This is above all an emergency, and not just any emergency. This is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced.
And we need to treat it accordingly so that people can understand and grasp the urgency. Because you can not solve a crisis without treating it as one. Stop telling people that everything will be fine when in fact, as it looks now, it won’t be very fine. This is not something you can package and sell or ”like” on social media.
Stop pretending that you, your business idea, your political party or plan will solve everything. We must realise that we don’t have all the solutions yet. Far from it. Unless those solutions mean that we simply stop doing certain things.
Changing one disastrous energy source for a slightly less disastrous one is not progress. Exporting our emissions overseas is not reducing our emission. Creative accounting will not help us. In fact, it’s the very heart of the problem.
Some of you may have heard that we have 12 years as from 1 January 2018 to cut our emissions of carbon dioxide in half. But I guess that hardly any of you have heard that there is a 50 per cent chance of staying below a 1.5 degree Celsius of global temperature rise above pre-industrial levels. Fifty per cent chance.
And these current, best available scientific calculations do not include non linear tipping points as well as most unforeseen feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas escaping from rapidly thawing arctic permafrost. Or already locked in warming hidden by toxic air pollution. Or the aspect of equity; climate justice.
So a 50 per cent chance – a statistical flip of a coin – will most definitely not be enough. That would be impossible to morally defend. Would anyone of you step onto a plane if you knew it had more than a 50 per cent chance of crashing? More to the point: would you put your children on that flight?
And why is it so important to stay below the 1.5 degree limit? Because that is what the united science calls for, to avoid destabilising the climate, so that we stay clear of setting off an irreversible chain reaction beyond human control. Even at 1 degree of warming we are seeing an unacceptable loss of life and livelihoods.
So where do we begin? Well I would suggest that we start looking at chapter 2, on page 108 in the IPCC report that came out last year. Right there it says that if we are to have a 67 per cent chance of limiting the global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, we had, on 1 January 2018, about 420 Gtonnes of CO2 left to emit in that carbon dioxide budget. And of course that number is much lower today. As we emit about 42 Gtonnes of CO2 every year, if you include land use.
With today’s emissions levels, that remaining budget is gone within less than 8 and a half years. These numbers are not my opinions. They aren’t anyone’s opinions or political views. This is the current best available science. Though a great number of scientists suggest even these figures are too moderate, these are the ones that have been accepted by all nations through the IPCC.
And please note that these figures are global and therefore do not say anything about the aspect of equity, clearly stated throughout the Paris Agreement, which is absolutely necessary to make it work on a global scale. That means that richer countries need to do their fair share and get down to zero emissions much faster, so that people in poorer countries can heighten their standard of living, by building some of the infrastructure that we have already built. Such as roads, hospitals, schools, clean drinking water and electricity.
The USA is the biggest carbon polluter in history. It is also the world’s number one producer of oil. And yet, you are also the only nation in the world that has signalled your strong intention to leave the Paris Agreement. Because quote “it was a bad deal for the USA”.
Four-hundred and twenty Gt of CO2 left to emit on 1 January 2018 to have a 67 per cent chance of staying below a 1.5 degrees of global temperature rise. Now that figure is already down to less than 360 Gt.
These numbers are very uncomfortable. But people have the right to know. And the vast majority of us have no idea these numbers even exist. In fact not even the journalists that I meet seem to know that they even exist. Not to mention the politicians. And yet they all seem so certain that their political plan will solve the entire crisis.
But how can we solve a problem that we don’t even fully understand? How can we leave out the full picture and the current best available science?
I believe there is a huge danger in doing so. And no matter how political the background to this crisis may be, we must not allow this to continue to be a partisan political question. The climate and ecological crisis is beyond party politics. And our main enemy right now is not our political opponents. Our main enemy now is physics. And we can not make “deals” with physics.
Everybody says that making sacrifices for the survival of the biosphere – and to secure the living conditions for future and present generations – is an impossible thing to do.
Americans have indeed made great sacrifices to overcome terrible odds before.
Think of the brave soldiers that rushed ashore in that first wave on Omaha Beach on D Day. Think of Martin Luther King and the 600 other civil rights leaders who risked everything to march from Selma to Montgomery. Think of President John F. Kennedy announcing in 1962 that America would 'choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard…'
Perhaps it is impossible. But looking at those numbers – looking at the current best available science signed by every nation – then I think that is precisely what we are up against.
But you must not spend all of your time dreaming, or see this as some political fight to win.
And you must not gamble your children’s future on the flip of a coin.
Instead, you must unite behind the science.
You must take action.
You must do the impossible.
Because giving up can never ever be an option."
The World is Waking Up;Speech At The U.N. Climate Action Summit 2019;New York City;September 23, 2019 ;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAJsdgTPJpU;https://www.npr.org/2019/09/23/763452863/transcript-greta-thunbergs-speech-at-the-u-n-climate-action-summit;"My message is that we'll be watching you.
This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you!
You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I'm one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!
For more than 30 years, the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you're doing enough, when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight.
You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency. But no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that. Because if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil. And that I refuse to believe.
The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50% chance of staying below 1.5 degrees [Celsius], and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control.
Fifty percent may be acceptable to you. But those numbers do not include tipping points, most feedback loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of equity and climate justice. They also rely on my generation sucking hundreds of billions of tons of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist.
So a 50% risk is simply not acceptable to us — we who have to live with the consequences.
To have a 67% chance of staying below a 1.5 degrees global temperature rise – the best odds given by the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] – the world had 420 gigatons of CO2 left to emit back on Jan. 1st, 2018. Today that figure is already down to less than 350 gigatons.
How dare you pretend that this can be solved with just 'business as usual' and some technical solutions? With today's emissions levels, that remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone within less than 8 1/2 years.
There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures here today, because these numbers are too uncomfortable. And you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is.
You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say: We will never forgive you.
We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.
Thank you."
We are the Change and Change is Coming;Global Climate Strike;Montreal;September 27, 2019;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihNvdY4INxk;https://www.environmentshow.com/greta-thunberg-speeches/;"Hello Montreal!
Your are a nation that is allegedly a climate leader and Sweden is also a nation that is allegedly a climate leader and in both cases it means absolutely nothing because in both cases it's just empty words
and the politics needed are still nowhere in sight so we are basically the same.
Last week, well over four million people in over 170 countries striked for the climate We march for a living planet and a safe future for everyone.
We spoke the science and demanded that the people in power would listen to and act on the science but our political leaders didn't listen
This week, world leaders from all around the world gathered in New York for the UN climate action summit.
They disappointed us once again with their empty words and insufficient plans.
We told them to unite behind the science, but they didn't listen.
So today we are millions around the world striking and marching again and we will keep on doing it until they listen.
If the people in power won't take responsibility then we will.
It should not be up to us but somebody needs to do it They say we shouldn't worry, that we should look forward
to a bright future but they forget that if they would have done their job, wouldn't need to worry.
If they had started acting in time then this crisis wouldn't be the crisis it is today.
We promise, once they start taking responsibility and do their job, We will stop worrying and go back to school and go back to work.
And once again, we are not communicating our opinions or political views.
The climate and ecological crisis is beyond party politics.
We are communicating the current best available science.
To some people, particularly those who in many ways have caused this crisis, that science is too uncomfortable to address
but we will have to live with the consequences and indeed those who are living with the climate with the climate ecological crisis already We don't have a choice.
To stay below 1.5 degrees and give us a chance to avoid the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control.
do that we must speak clearly and tell it like it is and tell the truth.
In the IPCC's SR 1.5 reports that came out last year it says, on page 108, in chapter 2, that, to have a 67 percent chance of staying below a 1.5 degrees of global temperature rise,
the best odds given by the IPCC, the world had 420 gigatons of CO2 left to emit back on January 1st 2018 and today figure is already down to less than 350 gigatons.
With today's emissions levels,
their remaining CO2 budgets will be entirely gone within less than eight and a half years and please note that these
calculations do not include already locked in warming hidden by toxic air pollution, nonlinear tipping points,
most feedback loops or the aspect of equity They are also relying on my generation,
your generation, sucking up hundreds of billions of tons of CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist.
And not once, not one single time have I heard any politician, journalist or business leader even mention these numbers.
They say: let children be children. We agree.
Let us be children. Do your part.
Communicate these kinds of numbers instead of leaving that responsibility to us.
Then we can go back to being children.
We are not in school today.
You're not at work today because this is an emergency and we will not be bystanders.
Some would say we are wasting lesson time, we say we are changing the world.
So that when we are older we will be able to look our children in the eyes and say that we did everything we could back then.
We will do everything in our power to stop this crisis from getting worse even if that means skipping school or work because...
... Because this is more important We have been told so many times that there is no point in doing this,
that we won't have an impact anyway, that we can't have an impact and make a difference.
I think we have proven that to be wrong by now.
Through history, the most important changes in society, have come from the bottom up, from grassroots.
The numbers are still coming in but it looks like well over six point six million people have joined the week for future, the strikes on this and last Friday.
That is one of the biggest demonstrations in history.
People have spoken and we will continue to speak until our leaders listen and act.
We are the change and change is coming.
Change happens whether you like it or not.
Thank you so much to everyone. Have a great day."
Remember the Facts;COP25 United Nations Climate Conference;Madrid;December 11, 2019;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4_SS3cOJrw;https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/greta-thunberg-un-climate-change-conference-speech-transcript;"A year and a half ago. I didn't speak to anyone unless I really had to.
but then I found a reason to speak. since then I've given many speeches and learned that when you talk in public you should start with something personal or emotional to get everyone's attention. 
say things like our house is on fire I wanted to panic or how dare you but today I will not do that because then those phrases are all that people focus on they don't remember the facts the very reason why I say those things in the first place. we no longer have time to leave out the science. without seeing
the full picture we will not solve this crisis finding holistic solutions is what the cop should be all about. 
but instead it seems to have turned into some kind of opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition. to stay below 1.5 degrees we need to keep the carbon in the ground only setting up distant dates and saying things which give the impression of that
action is underway will most likely do more harm than good because the changes required are still nowhere in sights the politics needed that does not exist today despite what you might hear from world leaders and I still believe that
the biggest danger is not inaction the real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening when in fact almost nothing is
being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR.
there is no sense of urgency whatsoever our leaders are not behaving as if we were in an emergency in an emergency you change your behavior if there's a child standing in the middle of the road and cars are coming at full speed you don't look away because it's too uncomfortable you immediately run out and rescue that
child and without that sense of urgency how can we the people understand that we are facing a real crisis.
and if the people are not fully aware of what is going on then they will not put pressure on the people in power to do to act. and why is it so important to stay below 1.5 degrees because even a 1 degree people are dying from the climate crisis because that is what the United science calls for to avoid destabilizing the climates so that we have the best
possible chance to avoid setting of irreversible chain reactions such as melting glaciers polar ice and throwing architech permafrost.
every fraction of a degree matters so there it is again.
this is my message this is what I want you to focus on.
so please tell me how do you react to these numbers without feeling at least some level of panic how do you respond to the facts that basically nothing is being done about this without feeling the slightest bits of anger and how do you communicate this without
sounding alarmist. I would really like to know we do not have to wait we can start the change right now. we the people. thank you"
We are telling you to act as if you loved your children above all else;World Economic Forum;Davos;January 21, 2020;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zn1UI6wx0Q;https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/greta-thunberg-davos-forum-speech-transcript;"One year ago I came to Davos and told you that our house is on fire. I said I wanted you to panic. I’ve been warned that telling people to panic about the climate crisis is a very dangerous thing to do, but don’t worry, it’s fine. Trust me, I’ve done this before and I can assure you it doesn’t lead to anything. And for the record, when we children tell you to panic, we’re not telling you to go on like before. We’re not telling you to rely on technologies that don’t even exist today at scale and that science says perhaps never will. We are not telling you to keep talking about reaching net zero emissions or carbon neutrality by cheating and fiddling around with numbers.
We’re not telling you to offset your emissions by just paying someone else to plant trees in places like Africa, while at the same time forests like the Amazon are being slaughtered at an infinitely higher rate. Planting trees is good of course, but it’s nowhere near enough of what is needed and it cannot replace real mitigation and rewilding nature. And let’s be clear, we don’t need a low carbon economy, we don’t need to lower emissions. Our emissions have to stop if you are to have a chance to stay below the 1.5 degree target. And until we have the technologies that at scale can put our emissions to minus, then we must forget about net zero we need real zero. Because distant net zero emission targets will mean absolutely nothing if we just continue to ignore the carbon dioxide budget that applies for today, not distant future dates. If high emissions continued like now, even for a few years, that budgets will soon be completely used up.
The fact that the USA is leaving the Paris Accord seem to outrage and worry everyone and it should, but the fact that we are all about to fail the commitments you signed up for in the Paris Agreement doesn’t seem to bother the people in power even the least. Any plan or policy of yours that doesn’t include a radical emission cuts at the source starting today is completely insufficient for meeting the 1.5 or well below two degree commitments of the Paris Agreements.
And again, this is not about right or left, we couldn’t care less about your party politics. From a sustainability perspective, the right the left as well as the center have all failed. No political ideology or economic structure has been able to tackle the climates, an environmental emergency and create the cohesive and sustainable world because of that world in case you haven’t noticed is currently on fire. You say children shouldn’t worry. You say, just leave this to us, we will fix this, we promise we won’t let you down. Don’t be so pessimistic. And then nothing, silence or something worse than silence, empty words and promises which give the impression that sufficient action is being taken.
All the solutions are obviously not available within today’s societies, nor do we have the time to wait for new technological solutions to become available to start drastically reducing our emissions. So of course the transition isn’t going to be easy. It will be hard and unless we start facing this now together with all cards on the table, we won’t be able to solve this in time. In the days running up to the 50th anniversary of the world economic forum, I joined a group of climate activists demanding that you the world’s most powerful and influential business and political leaders begin to take the action needed.
We demand at this year’s World Economic Forum, participants from all companies, banks, institutions and governments immediately hold all investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction, immediately end all fossil fuel subsidies and immediately and completely divest from fossil fuels. We don’t want these things done by 2050 or 2030 or even 2021 we want this done now. It may seem like we are asking for a lots and you will of course say that we are naive, but this is just the very minimum amount of effort that is needed to start the rapid sustainable transition. So either you do this or you’re going to have to explain to your children why you are giving up on the 1.5 degree target giving up without even trying.
Well, I’m here to tell you that unlike you, my generation will not give up without a fight. The facts are clear but they are still too uncomfortable for you to address. You just leave it because you just think it’s too depressing and people will give up. The people will not give up. You are the ones who are giving up. Last week I met with Polish coal miners who lost their jobs because their mind was closed and even they had not given up. On the country they seem to understand the fact that we need to change more than you do. I wonder what will you tell your children was the reason to fail and leave them facing a climate chaos that you knowingly brought upon them? That it seems so bad for the economy that we decided to resign the idea of securing future living conditions without even trying. Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fueling the flames by the hour, and we are telling you to act as if you loved your children above all else. Thank you."
You Cannot Make Deals with Physics;European Parliament;Brussels;March 4, 2020;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztQzW4qfKEs;https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/greta-thunberg-davos-forum-speech-transcript;"my name is greta thunberg. I am a climate activist and a part of Friday's for future movement and for over one and a half years we have been sacrificing our education to protest against your inaction. 
in September over seven and a half million people all around the world took to the streets demanding you to unite behind the science in order to give us a safe future then in November 2009 teen the European Parliament declared climate and environment emergency you said that the EU would lead against the existential threat of the climate crisis and this was wonderful news when your children set off the fire alarm you went outside took a look and smell the air and you stated that yes the house is actually burning this was no false alarm but then you went back inside finished your dinner and watched
your movie and went to bed without even calling the fire department I'm sorry but this makes no sense at all when your house is on fire you don't wait a few more years to start putting it out and yet this is what the Commission are proposing today when the EU presents this climate law and net zero by 2050 you indirectly admit surrender that you are giving up giving up on the Paris agreement giving up on your promises and giving up on doing everything you possibly can to
ensure a safe future for your own children because this law is based on an insufficient co2 budget but in reality gives us much much less than a 50% chance of limiting the global average temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees Celsius and any climate law or policy
that is not based on the current best available science and does not include the global aspect of equity nor the annual emissions reductions needed starting now will be completely insufficient of course such law sends a
strong signal that real sufficient action is taking place when effects it is not the hard truth is that neither the awareness nor the politics needed or anywhere in sight we are still in a
crisis that has never once been treated as a crisis we do have lots of brilliant solutions we have unprecedented wealth
and financial assets we have a lot of goodwill and countless of people ready to do everything they can to help what
we do not have is awareness leadership and above all time our rapidly disappearing carbon budgets are the
bottom line that sums up the current best available climate science no matter
how insufficient they may be as they don't include tipping points most
feedback loops equity nor additional warming hidden by air pollution
they are still the most reliable road map we have to safeguard the future
living conditions for humankind but the contents of these budgets
never been taken into account in today's politics it has never been communicated
in mainstream media and yet here you are
trying to create laws and policies once
again ignoring it pretending that your plan or policy disregarding the United
science will somehow soul the biggest
crisis humanity has ever faced pretending that's a law that no one has
to follow is a law and pretending that you can be a climate leader and still go
on building and subsidizing new fossil fuel infrastructure
[Applause]
pretending that leaving out the global aspect of climate justice and equity
won't risk breaking up the entire Paris
agreement pretending that empty words will make this emergency go away
this must come to an end no policy plan
or deal will be nearly enough as long as you just continue to ignore the co2
budget which applies for today we don't
just need goals for 2030 or 2050 we above all need them for 2020 and for
every following year to come we need to
start cutting our emissions drastically at the source now you're distant targets will mean
nothing if high emissions continue like today's business as usual even for just
a few more years because that will use
up our remaining carbon budgets before you will able have the chance to deliver
on your 2030 or 2050 goals and since these negative emissions technologies
that this law fully relies on don't exist today at scale and perhaps never
will we simply need to change our behavior change our society and this is
the uncomfortable truth that you can't
escape no matter how badly you want to
or how hard you try and the longer you keep running away from that truth the
bigger your betrayal towards your own
children the EU must lead the way you have the moral obligation to do so and
you have a unique economical and political opportunity to become a real
climate leader you yourselves declared that we are in a climate and environment
emergency
you said this was an existential threat now you must prove that you mean it and
we will not be satisfied with anything
less from science-based pathway which gives us the best possible chance to
safeguard the future living conditions
for Humanity and life on earth as we know it anything else is surrender this climate
law is surrender because nature doesn't bargain and you cannot make deals with
physics and we will not allow you to surrender on our future"
